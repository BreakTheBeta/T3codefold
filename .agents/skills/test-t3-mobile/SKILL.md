description: Test T3 Code's native iOS and Android app through its Device panel and returned AgentDevice command. Use for mobile verification, native-client builds, Metro launch, and mobile pairing against isolated development state.

# Test T3 Mobile

## Open the device

Call `device_list`, then `device_open` with the selected host and device IDs.
T3 boots the device and shows its live stream in the Device panel. Follow its
returned `quickStart`, using the exact `agentDevice.command` and all `targetArgs`
on every operation. Use `device_screenshot` to inspect the screen.

If T3 device tools or the selected device are unavailable, report the blocker
and stop verification. Do not install or switch to another automation system.

## Use an isolated backend

Reuse this task's healthy backend. Otherwise run `vp run dev` from the
repository root, retain its terminal session, and read the actual backend port
from the dev-runner output. Use the worktree's ignored `.t3` state. Never run
against `~/.t3/userdata`. The Browser panel is not required for this workflow.

Test with meaningful project and thread data. Read the shared
[SQLite fixture reference](../test-t3-app/references/sqlite-fixtures.md) only
when inspecting or seeding SQLite. Stop the test server before fixture writes.

## Launch T3 Code Dev

From the checkout being tested on the selected device host, run:

```bash
node scripts/mobile-native-client.ts ensure <ios|android> <device-id>
```

This reuses a matching native client or builds and installs one. Authorized
mobile verification includes that build step unless the user prohibits it.

The Android path is incremental and must stay that way. It keeps this worktree's
generated `android/` project, builds only the connected emulator's ABI, and
installs by adb serial. After an interruption, rerun the same command so Gradle
resumes from completed work. Do not reach for `expo prebuild --clean` or delete
`android/`: the rebuild costs roughly an hour, and Expo's fingerprint plus
Gradle's task invalidation already handle changed native inputs.

Two caches are shared across every worktree on the host, so a dependency another
checkout already compiled is usually free here: Gradle's local build cache in the
Gradle user home, and ccache for NDK objects. Install ccache if `ensure` warns it
is missing. What is _not_ shareable is the generated `android/` tree and its
`.gradle`, `build`, and `.cxx` directories — they embed absolute paths, so never
symlink or copy them between worktrees. Let the content-addressed caches do it.

Start `vp run dev:client` from `apps/mobile`, or reuse a healthy Metro belonging
to this checkout. Open its printed development-client URL with AgentDevice
`open com.t3tools.t3code.dev <url>` and all returned target arguments.
The device must be able to reach both Metro and the isolated backend.

## Pair and verify

Use the helper from the repository root, with the returned executable and target
arguments stored in `agent_device_command` and the Bash array
`agent_device_target_args`:

```bash
.agents/skills/test-t3-mobile/scripts/pair-client.sh \
  <server-port> <base-dir> <device-reachable-backend-origin> \
  "$agent_device_command" "${agent_device_target_args[@]}"
```

It issues a fresh credential and opens T3 Code Dev's existing pairing route
through AgentDevice. For a backend on the device host, use
`http://127.0.0.1:<server-port>` on iOS or `http://10.0.2.2:<server-port>`
on Android. For a remote backend, use its reachable origin.

Confirm the intended projects appear, exercise the affected flow, and capture
evidence. Retain the app and environment while iterating. At teardown, remove
the disposable connection, close the AgentDevice session, call `device_close`,
and stop only your backend and Metro processes.

## Troubleshooting

- **Android build cannot find a device matching the adb serial:** rerun `ensure`.
  It targets the serial directly through Gradle and adb, and never passes it to
  Expo's device-name lookup.
- **Android cannot reach Metro:** verify `adb reverse` for the exact Metro port,
  then relaunch the development-client URL.
- **Android cannot reach the backend:** use `10.0.2.2`, not `127.0.0.1`, for the
  Android Emulator.
- **An Android build is slower than expected:** check `ccache -s` for hits. A
  fresh worktree whose `.cxx` is empty still recompiles, but ccache should serve
  most objects. Zero hits usually means the NDK or compiler flags changed.
