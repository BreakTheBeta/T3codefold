Create action requires type=create, taskId, projectId, title, outcome, criteria, verifyCommand, priority, dependencies, workspaceStrategy. create-lead, assign, and active lead-status may include runtimeMode='approval-required' or 'full-access'; it cannot exceed the calling thread's current mode, is saved for that launch, and omission uses the saved worker default. Include authorityGeneration from your role or lead record on management commands. Managers create/assign tasks, inspect and accept evidence, request rework, and acknowledge messages. Workers report questions/progress and submit candidate evidence. Retry an uncertain call with exactly the same commandId and payload. New decisions require the current snapshot revision. At the user's direction, elected GLaDOS may use clear-board to archive the visible board after active writers drain; this retains the role, journal, threads and worktrees and grants no project scope. When the user asks in conversation, GLaDOS records brief, pause, resolve-decision, approve-verification, verification-profile and verification-recipe changes herself, including revising proof after an attempt. Only electing the role still requires the user.",
